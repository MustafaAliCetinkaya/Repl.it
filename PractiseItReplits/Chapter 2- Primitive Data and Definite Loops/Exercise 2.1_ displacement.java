/*In physics, a common useful equation for finding the position s of a body in linear motion at a given time t, based on 
its initial position s0, initial velocity v0, and rate of acceleration a, is the following:

s = s0 + v0 t + ½ at2

Write code to declare variables for s0 with a value of 12.0, v0 with a value of 3.5, a with a value of 9.8, and t with a value 
of 10, and then write the code to compute s on the basis of these values. At the end of your code, print the value of your 
variable s to the console./*

double s = 12.0;
double v = 3.5;
double a = 9.8;
int t = 10;
double position = s + v * t + 0.5 * a * t * t;
System.out.println(position);
