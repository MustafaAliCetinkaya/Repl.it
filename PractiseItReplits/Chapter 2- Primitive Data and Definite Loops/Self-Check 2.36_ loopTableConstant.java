/*Assume that you have a variable called line that will take on the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on, and a class constant named 
SIZE that takes two values. You are going to formulate expressions in terms of line and SIZE that will yield different 
sequences of numbers of characters. The first row is filled in for you as an example. Fill in the solution boxes below, 
indicating an expression that will generate each sequence. Your answers must be in the exact 
format 'coefficient1 * line + (coefficient2 * SIZE + offset)' in that order to be counted as correct.*/
1. 4 * line + (3 * SIZE)
2. line - (2 * SIZE) + 3
