/* 
* Write an instance method named transactionFee that will be placed inside
* the BankAccount class to become a part of each BankAccount object's
* behavior. The transactionFee method accepts a fee amount (a real number) as
* a parameter, and applies that fee to the user's past transactions. The fee
* is applied once for the first transaction, twice for the second
* transaction, three times for the third, and so on. These fees are subtracted
* out from the user's overall balance. If the user's balance is large enough
* to afford all of the fees with greater than $0.00 remaining, the method
* returns true. If the balance cannot afford all of the fees or has no money
* left, the balance is left as 0.0 and the method returns false.
