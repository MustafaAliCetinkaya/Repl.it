/*Why does a method to swap two array elements work correctly when a method to swap two integer values does not?
 a. Unlike integers, arrays are objects and use reference semantics.
 b. Because of a bug in Java.
 c. Because arrays use more memory than primitive values.
 d. Because arrays are slower and more inefficient than primitives, so swapping is possible.
 e. Changes to an array parameter's elements will not be seen in the original array by the caller.*/
