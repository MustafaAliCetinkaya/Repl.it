/*Consider a method getGrade that accepts an integer representing a student's grade percentage in a course and returns that student's numerical course grade:

public static double getGrade(int percentage) {
    ...
}

The grade can be between 0.0 (failing) and 4.0 (perfect).

Which of the following are precondition(s) that are appropriate for this method? Check all that apply.

 a. The parameter's value must be greater than or equal to 0.
 b. The parameter's value must be between 0.0 and 4.0.
 c. The parameter can be an integer or a real number.
 d. The parameter's value must be less than or equal to 100.
 e. The parameter must be a letter grade of 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'.*/
  a. The parameter's value must be greater than or equal to 0.
