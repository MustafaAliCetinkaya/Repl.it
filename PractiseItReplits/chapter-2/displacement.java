/*
* In physics, a common useful equation for finding the position s of a body 
* in linear motion at a given time t, based on its initial position s0, initial 
* velocity v0, and rate of acceleration a, is the following:
* s = s0 + v0 t + Â½ at2
*
* Write code to declare variables for s0 with a value of 12.0, v0 with a value of 
* 3.5, a with a value of 9.8, and t with a value of 10, and then write the code to 
* compute s on the basis of these values. At the end of your code, print the value 
* of your variable s to the console.
