```
Hint:

1. Create an object of Scanner class. 
2. Declare int 3 variables
3. Use Scanner to assign numbers from console into the variables
4. Use if statements to find the middle number
```

Main topics: if statements, primitive variables, operators, Scanner


**Example Flows:**

```
Enter first number:
14
Enter second number:
52
Enter third number:
25

middle number is: 25
```
```
