/*Assume that you have a variable called count that will take on the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. You are going to formulate 
expressions in terms of count that will yield different sequences. The first row is filled in for you as an example. 
Fill in the solution boxes below, indicating an expression that will generate each sequence. Your answers should be 
in the form 'coefficient * count + constant' in that order, or the solution checking may not be accurate.
