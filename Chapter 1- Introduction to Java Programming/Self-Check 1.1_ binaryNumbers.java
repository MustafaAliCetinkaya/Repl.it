 b. It is easier to build electronic devices reliably if they only have to distinguish between two electric states.
 c. It is impossible to build a computer that uses a different number base than binary.
 d. It makes the computer faster and more efficient than other number bases.
 e. At the time when computers were invented, humans only knew about the numbers 0 and 1.*/
 
 b. It is easier to build electronic devices reliably if they only have to distinguish between two electric states.
