### Five friends are going to the theater. They have purchased a row of five seats with an aisle on either end.

#### 5 `String` variables are already declared with their names. These are the preferences of where the friends want to sit:

- James doesn't want to sit next to Jill
- Betty and Herb are dating and want to sit next to each other
- Bob wants to sit on the left side aisle
- James wants to sit an aisle seat

#### Construct and print the seating order following the friends' preferences. Separate the names with commas and a space

**Hint:** Use the name variables and concatenation 

Main topics: print statement, variables, concatenation, problem solving

An example of an invalid seating order is:

- `James, Betty, Herb, Bob, Jill`

The above arrangement is invalid because: Bob is not sitting on left aisle.
