### Create a program that will build a custom computer by selecting each part and computing the total price. Use the following requirements for each section:

**First ask the user about the screen size**
> Select screen size:
> - For a screen size of `13.3`, add `$200` to the total price
> - For a screen size of `15.0`, add `300` to the total price
> - For screen size of `17.3`, add `$400` to the total price

**Then ask the user about the CPU**
> Select CPU type:
> - For a CPU of `i3`, add `$150` to the total price
> - For a CPU of `i5`, add `$250` to the total price
> - For a CPU of `i7`, add `$350` to the total price

**Then ask the user about the RAM size**
> Select RAM size:
> - Add `$50` to the total price for every 4GB of ram. Assume the ram amounts will be divisible by 4

**Then ask the user about the storage type and amount**
> Select storage type:

> Select storage size:

> - For `HDD`, add `$50` to the total price for every 500GB
> - For `SSD`, add `$100` to the total price for every 500GB

**Then ask the user about the screen resolution**
> Select screen resolution:
> - For `FULLHD`, add `$100` to the total price
> - For `4K`, add `$200` to the total price

** At the end display the total price of the custom computer**
> Laptop price is: $amount
