Today's Topics:
1. ArrayList
    Arraylist is a resizeable Array implementation, List Interface
    Arrays: fixed size, primitive/Object
    Arraylist: flexible, not fized size, stores Object only, comes with many useful methods
2.Custom Methods
        Access-Modifier Specifier ReturnType MethodName(Parameter){
            Statements
        }
         Access-Modifier:
         public: always reachable
         protected: same package or subclasses(inheritance) in the different package
         default : same package
         private: same class
3. Class&Object

        What is Class?: Template/blueprint, can be created without object.

        instanceVariable: should be created outside all the methods and they are attributes of objects
        initialization is NOT Mandatory; we initialize with object creation, they default values
        we can acccess via Objects
        Many copies

        Car c = new Car();
        c.instanceVariableName;

        staticVariable = Belongs to class, ONE copy, reach by ClassName and ObjectName
        initialization is NOT Mandatory;
