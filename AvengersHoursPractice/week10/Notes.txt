Exp 1:  we will create a method that will return count of even numbers, and parameter is an int Array

Exp 2: we will create a method that will return the difference between max and min numbers of an int Array

Exp 3: This example was implemented to show that we can call a method from other methods

Exp 4: Can I use a return of a method inside another method as of it's parameter

     ??   methodOne(String str, int x ) ?? public static int methodTwo(){}


PIQ: What is Method Overloading?
        str.substring (int beginningIndex)
        str.substring (int beginningIndex, int endingIndex)
rules: method has to have same name, with different parameters (number of parameters, type of parameters)

Wrapper Class:
int, double, char, short ... primitive

Integer X = new Integer(9); ----> Value is just 9
X is called object reference
9 is the value of that object

Since X is object reference; I can reach methods of these Wrapper Classes


Auto-boxing / Unboxing
If JAVA compiler makes your primitive data type to corresponding object wrapper class : Auto-boxing
if it is apposite way it is called unboxing

ArrayList: Can I put primitive inside Arraylist? NO NO NO

Data Structures:
Arrays : Fixed size, It can hold both primitive and object types

ArrayList part of Collections (List, Set, Map....): Only takes object types (so for primitive values we need Wrapper Classes)

ArrayList: Flexible size however it is slower comparing to Arrays
        Biggest advantage comes from usefull methods
