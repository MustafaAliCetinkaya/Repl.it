- for loop : repeatable if statement

***** Only gets executed if the condition is true. ***********

     for (initialization; Condition ; Iteration ) {
     statement
     }

     initialization : starting point

     Condition : ending point, created based on initialization

     Iteration: co-related to Condition. MUST be capable enough to make the condition false
